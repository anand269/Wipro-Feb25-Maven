SDET - Capstone Project & Evaluation criteria
Introduction
The Automation Testing Capstone Project focused on the website marked as significant milestone in the participants' learning journey. The project provided an opportunity to apply  knowledge and skills acquired during the automation testing training, incorporating Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Apache POI, a hybrid framework, and advanced reporting tools like Allure/Extent. The  objective is to create a comprehensive automation testing solution, fostering practical experience and showcasing participants' abilities to potential employers.
Problem Statement & Expectation 
In an online shopping/pet portal, where participants are going to work on different projects. Where user can register, login      and buy any of the available items. Users can search for the item and add to the cart. Update the cart with   quantity or with another item if required and make the payment. Objective is to Automate these workflows using Selenium with TestNG, Page Object Model and getting the data from data sheet/properties file. There by, we are testing faster and accurate using automation technique. 
Below picture is overview on the Automation scenarios to be covered by participants

 

Project Title: <Website name> (Team wise project)
Objective: The central aim of this capstone project is to construct a durable and streamlined test automation framework for evaluating the E-commerce/learning store. The framework integrates Selenium, TestNG, BDD-Cucumber, Apache POI, Hybrid methodology, reporting tools and basic API Testing.
Project Components:
1.	Test Case Design
2.	Test Automation Framework Development
3.	Test Execution
4.	Reporting
5.	Documentation - PPT
Project Requirements
1.	Test Case Design
•	Identify and document the test scenarios and test cases that will be automated.
•	Describe the test scenarios either through Page Object Model or Page Factory design pattern using TestNG or to write BDD (Behavior - Driven Development) style feature file.
•	Prioritize test cases based on their criticality and functionality coverage.
1.1	Test Case Requirement
•	Register
•	Login
•	Search
•	Product Details
•	Add to Cart
•	Payment/Checkout
2.	Test Automation Framework Development
2.1.	Framework Architecture
•	Implemented a hybrid automation testing framework that combines Data-Driven and POM /BDD approaches.
•	Using Page Object Model (POM)/page Factory design pattern to maintain the test object repository.
•	Structure the framework with modularity and scalability in mind.
2.2.	Selenium & TestNG Integration
•	Integrated Selenium WebDriver for web automation.
•	Using TestNG for test case management, execution, and reporting.
2.3.	Data-Driven Testing
•	Using Apache POI to read test data from Excel files & properties file.
•	Parameterize test cases to run with different data sets.
3.	API Automation Framework Development
3.1.	Framework Architecture
•	Implemented a hybrid API automation testing framework that combines different testing approaches, such as integration, functional
•	Structure the framework with modularity and scalability in mind.
3.2.	 Rest Assured
•	Using Rest Assured GET method we are retrieving the information from URL
4.	Test Execution
•	Executed the automated test cases on different browsers and platforms.
•	Implementing test suites to group and manage test cases effectively.
•	Handle exceptions and errors gracefully during test execution.

5.	Reporting
•	Implementing advanced reporting using tools like Extent or Allure.
•	Generate comprehensive test execution reports with detailed insights into test results, including screenshots and log files.
•	Ensure that reports are visually appealing and easy to interpret.

6.	Documentation
•	Create clear and concise documentation for your automation framework.
•	Include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting information.
•	Provide documentation on how to run the automated tests, generate reports, and interpret the results.
Project Deliverables
•	Complete Automation Testing Framework.
•	Test cases automated according to the defined scenarios.
•	Execution reports using Allure and Extent.
•	User documentation for the framework and reporting tools.
Evaluation Criteria
Your capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
•	Functionality: Does the automation framework effectively automate test cases?
•	Robustness: Does the framework handle exceptions and errors gracefully?
•	Scalability: Is the framework designed for easy addition of new test cases and features?
•	Advanced Reporting: Are advanced reports generated accurately using Allure and Extent?
•	Documentation: Is the project documentation comprehensive and easy to understand?
•	Coding contribution and standards
•	Knowledge on the topic
•	Assignments and attitude

Project Timeline
•	Start Date:29-06-24
•	End Date:06-07-24 
Submission Guidelines
•	Submit your project code and documentation as a zip file or through a version control repository (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab,…).
•	Ensure that all code and documentation are well-organized and clearly labeled.


Conclusion
The successful completion of this capstone project highlights the effective application of automation testing skills, incorporating advanced reporting tools. The project demonstrates competence in scenario identification, documentation, and prioritization, using the Gherkin language for BDD-style feature files. The experience gained not only enhances practical skills but also provides a valuable asset for resumes and interviews. Collaboration with mentors and instructors played a crucial role in ensuring project clarity. Overall, this project contributes to practical knowledge enrichment and sets the foundation for continued success in the field of automation testing.
